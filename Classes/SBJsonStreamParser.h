/**
 @brief Parse a stream of JSON data.
 
 Using this class directly you can reduce the apparent latency for each
 download/parse cycle of documents over a slow connection. You can start
 parsing *and return chunks of the parsed document* before the entire
 document is downloaded. Using this class is also useful to parse huge
 documents on disk bit by bit so you don't have to keep them all in memory. 

 The default behaviour is that the delegate only receives one call from
 either the -parser:foundArray: or -parser:foundObject: method when the
 document is fully parsed. However, if your inputs contains multiple JSON
 documents and you set the parser's -supportMultipleDocuments property to YES
 you will get one call for each full method.
 
 @code
 SBJsonStreamParser *parser = [[[SBJsonStreamParser alloc] init] autorelease];
 parser.delegate = self;
 parser.supportMultipleDocuments = YES;
 
 // Note that this input contains multiple top-level JSON documents
 NSData *json = [@"[]{}[]{}" dataWithEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; 
 [parser parse:data];
 @endcode
 
 In the above example @p self will have the following sequence of methods called on it:
 
 @li -parser:foundArray:
 @li -parser:foundObject:
 @li -parser:foundArray:
 @li -parser:foundObject:
 
 Often you won't have control over the input you're parsing, so can't make use of
 this feature. But, all is not lost: this class will let you get the same effect by 
 allowing you to skip one or more of the outer enclosing objects. Thus, the next
 example results in the same sequence of -parser:foundArray: / -parser:foundObject:
 being called on your delegate.
 
 @code
 SBJsonStreamParser *parser = [[[SBJsonStreamParser alloc] init] autorelease];
 parser.delegate = self;
 parser.levelsToSkip = 1;
 
 // Note that this input contains A SINGLE top-level document
 NSData *json = [@"[[],{},[],{}]" dataWithEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; 
 [parser parse:data];
 @endcode

 Normally the @p -parse: method returns SBJsonStreamParserComplete when it's found a complete JSON document.

 once an object is completed it will expect another object to immediately follow, separated
 only by (optional) whitespace.
