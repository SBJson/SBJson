* foo.in -> foo.out - test that JSON can be parsed and written back out
* foo.in -> foo.err - test that the parser correctly handles invalid JSON
* foo.plist -> foo.out - test that native structures are handled by the writer
* foo.plist -> foo.err - test that native invalid structures are handled by the writer
