  These are further steps to release to CocoaPods because I always forget.

  1. First install the CocoaPods gem:

     #+begin_src sh
     gem install --user cocoapods
     #+end_src

  2. Add pod dir to path:

     #+begin_src sh
     export PATH=$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin:$PATH
     #+end_src

  3. Bump version number in [[file:SBJson.podspec][SBJson.podspec]]

  4. Test the changes:

     #+begin_src sh
     pod spec lint SBJson.podspec --verbose
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:

  5. Once happy, push to trunk:

     #+begin_src sh
     pod trunk push SBJson.podspec --verbose
     #+end_src
